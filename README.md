# AlphaChain
In the early 2003-2004 during preparing my PhD thesis about theoretical calculations of lifetimes of Super Heavy nuclei  
I've decided to handle `Fortran` output data for each nuclei using .NET.

The aim of the calculation was to choose a "path" of consequent alpha decays for the `Darmstatium 269` and `Ds 271`.
In simple "not scientific" words to check all the posibilites for the `271Ds` (on a picture the "road is an arrows" of the decay):

`Calculated single-particle spectra of nuclei belonging to the Î±-decay chain`

## Code
To calculate this chain I had to campare the probabilites of each nuclei to emit gamma or aplpha:
- gamma - it is arrow to the bottom of nuclei
- aplha - it is an arrow to the left bottom

And that i a path of decaj :)
